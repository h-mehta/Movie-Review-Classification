# Movie Review Classification
 Text Classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes

I have used IMDB movie reviews dataset to classify reviews as 'positive' or 'negative'. The training dataset contains 800 positive and 800 negative movie reviews whereas the test set contains 200 positive and 200  negative movie reviews.


This was one of the first widely-available sentiment analysis datasets compiled by Pang and Lee's. The data was first collected in 2002, however, the text is similar to movies reviews one finds on IMDB today. The dataset is in a CSV format. It has two categories: Pos (reviews that express a positive or favourable sentiment) and Neg (reviews that express a negative or unfavourable sentiment). It is assumed that all reviews are either positive or negative; there are no neutral reviews.


A Multinomial Naive Bayes classification model was built for the same.
